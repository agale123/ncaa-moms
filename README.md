The goal of this script is to analyze the impact of Holly Rowe's report on Adia
Barnes breastfeeding her child and pumping during halftime.

## Methodology

I searched for Tweets on 4/4 and 4/5 with combinations of "Adia Barnes" and
"Arizona coach" with "breastfeeding", "pumping", "mother", "nursing", and
"normalize". For each Tweet I included details on the content of the Tweet,
whether it was a retweet, and how many favorites and retweets it got. Using
this method I collected 377 Tweets.

## Findings

### Tweets over time

The first analysis I did was to plot the Tweets over time to see when there was
the most activity. From the histogram below, you see a large spike after 4PM on
Sunday which is when the feature from Holly Rowe aired. There was also another
spike on Monday morning.

The next step was to find the top favorited and retweeted tweets. The five Tweets
with the most likes and the Tweets with the most retweets were the same set. The
table below highlights these tweets with links to the original content. The top
Tweet from [@TheUndefeated](https://twitter.com/TheUndefeated) also embedded a
video with over 51,000 views.

### Tweet sentiment

The final analysis I performed was sentiment analysis on the contents of the Tweets
to see if there is overall positive feedback to Holly Rowe's report on Adia Barnes.
I did find that 60% of the Tweets were marked as having positive sentiment. When I
looked closer at the tweets with the stronger "negative" sentiment, I found that for
some reason the quote from the feature: "For those of you who think this is too much
information,' [ESPN‚Äôs Holly Rowe] told viewers from the sideline, 'let‚Äôs normalize
working mothers and all they have to do." is calculated to have negative sentiment.
Of the tweets analyzed, all of the ones marked as having "negative" sentiment were
actually positive Tweets. This indicates a broader issue with how sentiment
analysis scores statements like these. So overall all the Tweets I analyzed were
supportive of Adia Barnes and the profile of her during the game.
